ALE Library
===========
Apache UserALE.PyQt5 intercepts all application events by letting the developer install an event filter in their PyQt5 application to generate detailed user logs. Apache UserALE.PyQt5 does not capture system level logs or events generated by a non-user (a.k.a. system and signals sent between QObjects).
